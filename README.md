This repository is a **basic enviroment** setup for an easy development start. <br />
It comes with _jquery_, _eslint_ and _webpack_ for now.

## How to use

After cloning this repository via `git clone https://github.com/wlfnkls/fundamentum.git` you have to install the dependencies via `npm install`.

At this time, I implemented _webpack_ to build your JavaScript. Just create your *.js-file in the **src**-folder and import it in the **index.js**. <br />
To build the **main.js** just run `npm run dev` and the **main.js** is created in the **dist**-folder.
